FlatOut HTML Compiler
=======

Simple PHP-based HTML compiler for prototyping.

I created this because I needed a way to compile modules into full pages
and didn't have ability to install or configure any other utilities, like Grunt. PHP 
was available on my localhost so that's what I used.

By all rights, you can create your own using Mustache and other options, and it will
have many more bells and whistles.


Basic use
==

Include flatout.php at the top of your page and make sure you save your page as a .php file.

Click the Compile button and a flat HTML file will be created in the output/ folder

See the readme.html for details and syntax
